    title: "About Falcon Festival",
    desc: "Falcon Festival is an annual event which happens every year at Umrangso. This festival aims at creating an awareness among the people about Amur Falcons, the longest traveled migratory birds. Amur falcons come each year during the last week of October or first week of November to roost in Dima Hasao, Assam. Due to lack of awareness these birds used to be killed for sport and fun. Blue Hills Society, a reputed NGO from Haflong, Dima Hasao : Assam took up the initiative to protect our winged friends (Amur Falcons) from harm's ways, they have collaborated with Wild Life Trust of India, Department of Forest (Assam), Dima Hasao District Administration, North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council and other local youth forums in this matter. This festival is organized after analyzing a huge response from the local people, youths, policy makers and other administrative departments, through this festival, Blue Hills Society aims at boosting the tourism sector of the district. Since Dima Hasao is stocked with nature's bounty and rich in flora and fauna, this festival will be an invitation for tourists, researchers and nature enthusiasts to come and explore Dima Hasao.",
